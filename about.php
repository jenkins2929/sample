<div class="div2">Student Feedback system for College
Here we have developed the a faculty feedback system, which is generally used in the college to rate the faculty based on the performance...Here we have 2 modules such as administrator, student.

Administrator is the one who creates the student account by adding all student info and assigning the username and password. 
Admin can check the feedback report of all students who entered the feedback.
We can start the development from the login page, where we have given the option to login as admin and student...Here since we have only one admin account, so no need to create the a database to store admin info...so the admin can login by giving their username:"admin@gmail.com" and password:"admin"...select admin in the radio button and login 

You can perform all admin actions such as login to the account and check result..

Student can login by their respective credentials and can submit feedback about faculty performance


Before we can look into the php code, you need to create a database calledÂ "feedback"..</div>
